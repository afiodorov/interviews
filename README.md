Interviews
==========

Set of pretty standard solutions for questions commonly asked at interviews. All of it is written by me.
The solutions include:
* Simple heap implementation using std::vector as a storage: ./src/includes/heap.cpp
* Heapsort: src/heapSort.cpp
* Singly linked list class: ./src/includes/linkedlist.cpp
* Stack class: ./src/includes/stack.cpp
* Queue implemented using an array: ./src/includes/queue.cpp
* Queue implemented using stacks: ./src/includes/stack.cpp
* Tree class: ./src/includes/smartTree.cpp
  * InOrder, PostOrder, PreOrder traversal using recursion
  * PreOrder iterative traversal and a stack
  * PreOrder iterative traversal using no stack (just parent pointer of each node)
  * InOrder successor of a node
* Binary Search Tree class: ./src/includes/smartSearchTree.cpp
  * insertion of a node 
  * deletion of a node
  * contructing a tree by shuffling a vector
  * constructing a minimum height tree out of a vector: ./src/searchTree.cpp
  * building linked lists out of each tree depth level: ./src/searchTree.cpp
* Towers of Hanoi recursive solution: ./src/towers.cpp
* Three stacks implemeted using array: ./src/threeStacksOneArray.cpp
* Sorting stack elements using another stack: ./src/stacksort.cpp
* Stack which remembers its minimum: ./src/stackMin.cpp
* Primitive grep function: ./src/queries.cpp
* Finding all permutations recursively: ./src/permutations.cpp
* Finding if a string is a substring of another string using one call: ./src/isSubstringOneCall.cpp
* Finding if a string is an anogram of another string using a merge sort: ./src/anograms.cpp
* Represent a number as a linked list. Adding two numers: ./src/addLinkedLists.cpp
